## Linear and Logistic Regression - HelloWorld for AIML
### Linear Regression - Predict the price of a home, based on multiple different variables. Use sci-kit’s linear_model.LinearRegression()
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm that determines the relationship between one dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x). It models a target prediction value based on the dependent variable, using this determined relationship. 

A linear regression line has the equation **Y=mX + b**

where Y is the dependent variable, m is the slope, X is the dependent variable and b is the y intercept. 

If there is more than one independent variable, the equation will be modified to 

**Y = m<sub>1</sub>X<sub></sub>1</sub> +</sub> m<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>3</sub>X<sub>3</sub> + … + b**

The regression algorithm is being implemented using Jupyter Notebook using some standard built in Python libraries, which include:
<ol>
  <li><strong>NumPy</strong> supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these.</li>
  <li><strong>Pandas</strong>, a software library written mainly for data manipulation and analysis purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Scikit-learn</strong> is a popular machine learning library with various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong> is a library that works as an extension of NumPy. It provides an API for embedding plots into applications.</li>
</ol>
The code can be split into the following major steps:

<ol>
  <li>Importing all the dependent modules and libraries</li>
</ol>
