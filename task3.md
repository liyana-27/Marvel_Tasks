# Numpy
## Using Numpy Generate an array by repeating a small array across each dimension and Generate an array with element indexes such that the array elements appear in ascending order.
Numpy is a Python library that supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these.
There are built in / pre-existing functions in Numpy that exist to perform the above mentioned tasks.

The np.array() function creates arrays (single or multi-dimensional). The tile() function repeats the given array elements across the respective dimension.

The argsort() function returns an array of the original array elements’ indices such that the indices represent the elements in ascending order.

Both of these have been demonstrated in the following images:
