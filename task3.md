# Numpy
## Using Numpy Generate an array by repeating a small array across each dimension and Generate an array with element indexes such that the array elements appear in ascending order.
Numpy is a Python library that supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these.
There are built in / pre-existing functions in Numpy that exist to perform the above mentioned tasks.

The np.array() function creates arrays (single or multi-dimensional). The tile() function repeats the given array elements across the respective dimension.

The argsort() function returns an array of the original array elementsâ€™ indices such that the indices represent the elements in ascending order.

Both of these have been demonstrated in the following images:
