# Data Visualisation
## using matplotlib and diff kinds of plots. (Bar, scatter, Time Series and Histogram).
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is one of the most popular two dimensional graphic libraries. It works as an extension of NumPy. It provides an API for embedding the plots directly into applications.

The general flow of events for creating a plot in Jupyter Notebook using Matplotlib is as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Import all the dependencies (matplotlib and numpy/pandas)</li>
  <li>Create x and y data to plot</li>
  <li>Create an instance of a subplot to hold your plot</li>
  <li>Use the plot() function to plot your data</li>
  <li>Customize the plot to display additional information</li>
  <li>Show the plot</li>
</ol>

Thereâ€™s a large variety of graphs we can plot using Matplotlib ranging from simple line plots to complex three dimensional plots.
<ol>
  <li>Line Plots</li>
  <li>Scatter Plots</li>
  <li>Bar Graphs</li>
  <li>Horizontal Bar Graphs</li>
  <li>Histogram</li>
  <li>Time Series</li>
  <li>Pie Charts</li>
</ol>
